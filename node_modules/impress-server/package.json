  "readme": "# Impress.js server\n\nImpress-server enables you to share an [impress.js](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/) \npresentation with other users. It is not only a remote control, but every user who opens \nthe presentation while it is in presentation mode, will have the state of the presentation \nsynced in real time to his browser.\n\n## What problem does it solve ?\nIn our company we permanently have video conferences with customers. Whenever \nwe want to run a presentation for them we have to do this via a screen sharing \ntool. Screen sharing is fine but the quality is poor and it uses a lot of bandwith. \nWith impress-server you can run a remote presentation with nearly no bandwidth useage \nat all and in full impress.js quality.\n\nIn addition to that, you can use impress-server just to give you the ability to \nremote control your presentation with your phone or another computer.\n\n## Install\nInstall via NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install impress-server\n```\n\n## Prepare presentation\nChange into on of your impress presentation folder. Make sure to name your \npresentation file ```index.html```. All other resources for your presentation (like \nimages and css) should be put into this directory as well.\n\nImpress-server needs a specific impress.js version to run presentation sharing. \nStarting with impress-server 0.0.8 you no longer need to adopt your presentations html \nfile. Just make sure you're loading a ```impress.js``` JavaScript file and you're done.\n\n##Start server\nWhen everything is prepared, start the impress-server by typing:\n```bash\nimpress-server\n```\nImpress-server also takes arguments for port (-p) and directory (-d) it should serve. \nThe server generates a password on startup which you need later to claim the presentation \nmode. You can provide your own password by providing a password (--pw) param at server \nstartup.\n\n## Using a mobile device as remote control\nSince version 0.0.7, impress-server supports a remote controller. To enable your \nphone to act as a remote, point its browser to your presentation server on the route \n/remote. \n\n```\nhttp://yourservername:8080/remote\n```\nYou now should see the remote ui. On the bottom of the page you can enter your impress-server \npassword and claim the presentation mode. Tapping with your finger on the left/right \narrows will go to the previous/next page. On Adroid (using Browser, Chrome or Firefox) \nyou can also swipe your finger left or right to move forwards or backwards (had no chance \nto test this on an iPhone).\n\n## Sharing a presentation\nA presentation is not shared by default but only hosted. Every user visiting \nyour presentation can navigate the presentation himself. If you like to switch \nto presentation mode, you currently have to hack your way in :) .\n\nOpen your browsers web developer tools (you should know how to do this if you can\n create impress.js presentations) and go to console. Type the following:\n\n```js\napi.claimPresenter(\"your password\");\n```\nThe password is shown when you startup your server. If everything works a short message \nshould be shown, telling you that you are now in presentation mode. All current and future visitors will be in view only mode from now on. They have to view the slide your browser is currently showing. So you're in god mode now :) .\n\nThere are several other api commands you can use:\n```js\n// stop presentation mode, all users can navigate on their own\napi.releasePresenter();\n\n// a user in view mode can exit view mode and navigate himself\napi.ignorePresenter();\n\n// a user who previously ignored the presenter can refollow the presentation\napi.followPresenter();\n\n// navigate the presentation\napi.next();\napi.prev();\napi.goto(2);\n```\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Thomas Profelt &lt;office@protom.eu&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
