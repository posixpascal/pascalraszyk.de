So in this series of blog posts, I'm showing you how to build a desktop (and later web app) application around the beautiful `Jekyll` static page generator. Jekyll is a utility which makes creating static web pages a breezes, just create a default layout, add posts and let jekyll do the rest.

If you're looking for a live example of jekyll look no further because **this** blog is actually build using Jekyll.
