I'm reading a lot about `good code` on blogs, reddit posts etc, reading about how to apply styleguides to projects, using integrated build systems, Test Driven Development and there are many many more tech-y keywords I could list here but I'll omit them for the sake of short blog posts.

I'm working for an agency at the moment and the one thing you shouldn't mess up is ... the deadline.
So whenever a client demands a project, he'll expect us to deliver it in time and also expects a good project.
Client's do not care about how you structure your code, or how well you wrote your unit tests.
