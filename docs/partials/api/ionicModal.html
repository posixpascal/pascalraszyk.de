<div class="description"><div class="ionicmodal-page"><p>Instantiated by the <a href="#/api/ionic.service:$ionicModal">ionic.service:$ionicModal</a> service.</p>
<p>Be sure to call <a href="#remove">remove()</a> when you are done with each modal
to clean it up and avoid memory leaks.</p>
<p>Note: a modal will broadcast &#39;modal.shown&#39;, &#39;modal.hidden&#39;, and &#39;modal.removed&#39; events from its originating
scope, passing in itself as an event argument. Note: both modal.removed and modal.hidden are
called when the modal is removed.</p>
