<div class="description"><div class="-compileprovider-imgsrcsanitizationwhitelist-page"><p>Retrieves or overrides the default regular expression that is used for whitelisting of safe
urls during img[src] sanitization.</p>
<p>The sanitization is a security measure aimed at prevent XSS attacks via html links.</p>
<p>Any url about to be assigned to img[src] via data-binding is first normalized and turned into
an absolute url. Afterwards, the url is matched against the <code>imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist</code>
regular expression. If a match is found, the original url is written into the dom. Otherwise,
the absolute url is prefixed with <code>&#39;unsafe:&#39;</code> string and only then is it written into the DOM.</p>
