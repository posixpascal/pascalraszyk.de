<div class="description"><div class="-ionicconfigprovider-page"><p>Ionic automatically takes platform configurations into account to adjust things like what
transition style to use and whether tab icons should show on the top or bottom. For example,
iOS will move forward by transitioning the entering view from right to center and the leaving
view from center to left. However, Android will transition with the entering view going from
bottom to center, covering the previous view, which remains stationary. It should be noted
that when a platform is not iOS or Android, then it&#39;ll default to iOS. So if you are
developing on a desktop browser, it&#39;s going to take on iOS default configs.</p>
<p>These configs can be changed using the <code>$ionicConfigProvider</code> during the configuration phase
of your app. Additionally, <code>$ionicConfig</code> can also set and get config values during the run
phase and within the app itself.</p>
<p>By default, all base config variables are set to <code>&#39;platform&#39;</code>, which means it&#39;ll take on the
default config of the platform on which it&#39;s running. Config variables can be set at this
level so all platforms follow the same setting, rather than its platform config.
The following code would set the same config variable for all platforms:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$ionicConfigProvider.views.maxCache(10);</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, each platform can have it&#39;s own config within the <code>$ionicConfigProvider.platform</code>
property. The config below would only apply to Android devices.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$ionicConfigProvider.platform.android.views.maxCache(5);</code></pre>
