<div><h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<div class="description"><div class="-ionicbackdrop-page"><p>Shows and hides a backdrop over the UI.  Appears behind popups, loading,
and other overlays.</p>
<p>Often, multiple UI components require a backdrop, but only one backdrop is
ever needed in the DOM at a time.</p>
<p>Therefore, each component that requires the backdrop to be shown calls
<code>$ionicBackdrop.retain()</code> when it wants the backdrop, then <code>$ionicBackdrop.release()</code>
when it is done with the backdrop.</p>
<p>For each time <code>retain</code> is called, the backdrop will be shown until <code>release</code> is called.</p>
<p>For example, if <code>retain</code> is called three times, the backdrop will be shown until <code>release</code>
is called three times.</p>
