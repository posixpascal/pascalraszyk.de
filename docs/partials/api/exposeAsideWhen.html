<div class="description"><div class="exposeasidewhen-page"><p>It is common for a tablet application to hide a menu when in portrait mode, but to show the
same menu on the left side when the tablet is in landscape mode. The <code>exposeAsideWhen</code> attribute
directive can be used to accomplish a similar interface.</p>
<p>By default, side menus are hidden underneath its side menu content, and can be opened by either
swiping the content left or right, or toggling a button to show the side menu. However, by adding the
<code>exposeAsideWhen</code> attribute directive to an <a href="#/api/ionic.directive:ionSideMenu">ionic.directive:ionSideMenu</a> element directive,
a side menu can be given instructions on &quot;when&quot; the menu should be exposed (always viewable). For
example, the <code>expose-aside-when=&quot;large&quot;</code> attribute will keep the side menu hidden when the viewport&#39;s
width is less than <code>768px</code>, but when the viewport&#39;s width is <code>768px</code> or greater, the menu will then
always be shown and can no longer be opened or closed like it could when it was hidden for smaller
viewports.</p>
<p>Using <code>large</code> as the attribute&#39;s value is a shortcut value to <code>(min-width:768px)</code> since it is
the most common use-case. However, for added flexibility, any valid media query could be added
as the value, such as <code>(min-width:600px)</code> or even multiple queries such as
<code>(min-width:750px) and (max-width:1200px)</code>.</p>
