<div><h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<div class="description"><div class="-ionicpopup-page"><p>The Ionic Popup service allows programmatically creating and showing popup
windows that require the user to respond in order to continue.</p>
<p>The popup system has support for more flexible versions of the built in <code>alert()</code>, <code>prompt()</code>,
and <code>confirm()</code> functions that users are used to, in addition to allowing popups with completely
custom content and look.</p>
<p>An input can be given an <code>autofocus</code> attribute so it automatically receives focus when
the popup first shows. However, depending on certain use-cases this can cause issues with
the tap/click system, which is why Ionic prefers using the <code>autofocus</code> attribute as
an opt-in feature and not the default.</p>
