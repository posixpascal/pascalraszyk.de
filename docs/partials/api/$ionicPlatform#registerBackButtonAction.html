<div class="description"><div class="-ionicplatform-registerbackbuttonaction-page"><p>Register a hardware back button action. Only one action will execute
when the back button is clicked, so this method decides which of
the registered back button actions has the highest priority.</p>
<p>For example, if an actionsheet is showing, the back button should
close the actionsheet, but it should not also go back a page view
or close a modal which may be open.</p>
<p>The priorities for the existing back button hooks are as follows:
  Return to previous view = 100
  Close side menu = 150
  Dismiss modal = 200
  Close action sheet = 300
  Dismiss popup = 400
  Dismiss loading overlay = 500</p>
<p>Your back button action will override each of the above actions
whose priority is less than the priority you provide. For example,
an action assigned a priority of 101 will override the &#39;return to
previous view&#39; action, but not any of the other actions.</p>
