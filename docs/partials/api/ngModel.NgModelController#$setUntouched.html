<div class="description"><div class="ngmodel-ngmodelcontroller-setuntouched-page"><p>Sets the control to its untouched state.</p>
<p>This method can be called to remove the <code>ng-touched</code> class and set the control to its
untouched state (<code>ng-untouched</code> class). Upon compilation, a model is set as untouched
by default, however this function can be used to restore that state if the model has
already been touched by the user.</p>
