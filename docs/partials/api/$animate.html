<div class="description"><div class="-animate-page"><p>The $animate service provides rudimentary DOM manipulation functions to
insert, remove and move elements within the DOM, as well as adding and removing classes.
This service is the core service used by the ngAnimate $animator service which provides
high-level animation hooks for CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>$animate is available in the AngularJS core, however, the ngAnimate module must be included
to enable full out animation support. Otherwise, $animate will only perform simple DOM
manipulation operations.</p>
<p>To learn more about enabling animation support, click here to visit the <a href="#/api/ngAnimate">ngAnimate module page</a> as well as the <a href="#/api/ngAnimate.$animate">ngAnimate $animate service page</a>.</p>
