<div class="description"><div class="-rootscope-scope-watch-page"><p>Registers a <code>listener</code> callback to be executed whenever the <code>watchExpression</code> changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>watchExpression</code> is called on every call to <a href="#/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest"><code>$digest()</code></a> and should return the value that will be watched. (Since
<a href="#/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest"><code>$digest()</code></a> reruns when it detects changes the
<code>watchExpression</code> can execute multiple times per
<a href="#/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest"><code>$digest()</code></a> and should be idempotent.)</li>
<li>The <code>listener</code> is called only when the value from the current <code>watchExpression</code> and the
previous call to <code>watchExpression</code> are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators">strict comparison</a>
 via the <code>!==</code> Javascript operator, unless <code>objectEquality == true</code>
(see next point)</li>
<li>When <code>objectEquality == true</code>, inequality of the <code>watchExpression</code> is determined
according to the <a href="#/api/angular.equals"><code>angular.equals</code></a> function. To save the value of the object for
later comparison, the <a href="#/api/angular.copy"><code>angular.copy</code></a> function is used. This therefore means that
watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.</li>
<li>The watch <code>listener</code> may change the model, which may trigger other <code>listener</code>s to fire.
This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to be notified whenever <a href="#/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest"><code>$digest</code></a> is called,
you can register a <code>watchExpression</code> function with no <code>listener</code>. (Since <code>watchExpression</code>
can execute multiple times per <a href="#/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest"><code>$digest</code></a> cycle when a
change is detected, be prepared for multiple calls to your listener.)</p>
<p>After a watcher is registered with the scope, the <code>listener</code> fn is called asynchronously
(via <a href="#/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalasync"><code>$evalAsync</code></a>) to initialize the
watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
of <code>watchExpression</code> didn&#39;t change. To detect this scenario within the <code>listener</code> fn, you
can compare the <code>newVal</code> and <code>oldVal</code>. If these two values are identical (<code>===</code>) then the
listener was called due to initialization.</p>
