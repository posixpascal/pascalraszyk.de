<div class="description"><div class="form-formcontroller-setpristine-page"><p>Sets the form to its pristine state.</p>
<p>This method can be called to remove the &#39;ng-dirty&#39; class and set the form to its pristine
state (ng-pristine class). This method will also propagate to all the controls contained
in this form.</p>
<p>Setting a form back to a pristine state is often useful when we want to &#39;reuse&#39; a form after
saving or resetting it.</p>
