<div class="description"><div class="-ionicconfigprovider-views-maxcache-page"><p>Maximum number of view elements to cache in the DOM. When the max number is
exceeded, the view with the longest time period since it was accessed is removed. Views that
stay in the DOM cache the view&#39;s scope, current state, and scroll position. The scope is
disconnected from the <code>$watch</code> cycle when it is cached and reconnected when it enters again.
When the maximum cache is <code>0</code>, the leaving view&#39;s element will be removed from the DOM after
each view transition, and the next time the same view is shown, it will have to re-compile,
attach to the DOM, and link the element again. This disables caching, in effect.</p>
