<div class="description"><div class="-compileprovider-ahrefsanitizationwhitelist-page"><p>Retrieves or overrides the default regular expression that is used for whitelisting of safe
urls during a[href] sanitization.</p>
<p>The sanitization is a security measure aimed at preventing XSS attacks via html links.</p>
<p>Any url about to be assigned to a[href] via data-binding is first normalized and turned into
an absolute url. Afterwards, the url is matched against the <code>aHrefSanitizationWhitelist</code>
regular expression. If a match is found, the original url is written into the dom. Otherwise,
the absolute url is prefixed with <code>&#39;unsafe:&#39;</code> string and only then is it written into the DOM.</p>
