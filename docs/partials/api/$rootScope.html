<div class="description"><div class="-rootscope-page"><p>Every application has a single root <a href="#/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope"><code>scope</code></a>.
All other scopes are descendant scopes of the root scope. Scopes provide separation
between the model and the view, via a mechanism for watching the model for changes.
They also provide an event emission/broadcast and subscription facility. See the
<a href="#/guide/scope">developer guide on scopes</a>.</p>
