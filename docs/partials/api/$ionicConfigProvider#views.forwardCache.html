<div class="description"><div class="-ionicconfigprovider-views-forwardcache-page"><p>By default, when navigating, views that were recently visited are cached, and
the same instance data and DOM elements are referenced when navigating back. However, when
navigating back in the history, the &quot;forward&quot; views are removed from the cache. If you
navigate forward to the same view again, it&#39;ll create a new DOM element and controller
instance. Basically, any forward views are reset each time. Set this config to <code>true</code> to have
forward views cached and not reset on each load.</p>
